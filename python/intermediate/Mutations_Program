"""Challenge
Write a function that satisfies the following rules:

Return true if the string in the first element of the list contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the list.
examples
["hello", "Hello"]

should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.
["hello", "hey"]

should return false because the string "hello" does not contain a "y".
["Alien", "line"]

should return true because all of the letters in "line" are present in "Alien". """
